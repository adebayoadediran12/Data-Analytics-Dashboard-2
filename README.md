NaijaStream, a Nigerian video-streaming platform, offers tiered subscriptions across four regions with multi-device accessibility. Despite generating ₦12M revenue, it faces a 49% churn rate and poor data visibility. The capstone project cleans data, defines KPIs, and builds dashboards to optimize retention, boost ARPU, and strategic decision-making.

NaijaStream is a Nigerian video-streaming platform designed to deliver quality content across the country. 
It offers three subscription tiers, Basic, Standard, and Premium—available in both monthly and annual billing cycles. 
The service is headquartered in Lagos and serves users nationwide across Nigeria’s four major regions: North, South, East, and West. 
Subscribers can access content via mobile phones, desktop computers, and smart TVs, ensuring multi-device accessibility. 
NaijaStream’s mission is to provide engaging content while leveraging data-driven strategies to enhance user experience and maximize retention.

**Key Characteristics of NaijaStream**

• Subscription-based model offering Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers to suit diverse needs and budgets.

• Wide geographical reach across Nigeria’s four major regions.

• Device usage distribution: 50% Desktop, 40% Mobile, 10% Smart TVs.

• Strong financial performance, with total revenue reaching ₦12 million and robust MRR and ARR indicators.

• High churn rate of approximately 49%, posing significant business challenges.

**Major Problems Facing NaijaStream**

NaijaStream’s rapid growth has been accompanied by key challenges:

• High churn rate of 49.35%, meaning nearly half of users discontinue subscriptions.

• Lack of visibility into regional and device-level subscription data, making it difficult to assess user behavior.

• Revenue unpredictability and weak investment strategies due to inadequate data insights.

• Limited retention efforts and reliance on reactive rather than proactive customer engagement strategies.

**Objectives of the Analysis**

• Analyze revenue drivers across regions, subscription tiers, and device types.

• Identify at-risk user segments prone to cancellation and revenue loss.

• Track subscriber trends and ARPU variations to optimize pricing and promotional strategies.

• Enable data-driven decision-making to improve engagement and maximize ROI.

**Specific Goals of the Visualization**

The analysis delivered a dynamic Excel dashboard that:

• Quantified revenue and orders, including MRR, ARR, and ARPU.

• Compared churn and retention across subscription tiers to measure loyalty.

• Provided insights into device usage distribution and regional revenue performance.

• Identified top revenue-generating states and monitored monthly growth trends.


**Critical Analysis and Insights**

• Regional Revenue: West Nigeria leads with ₦1.59 million (27% of total recurring revenue).

• User Tier Performance: Premium users’ ARPU is 46% above average, while Basic users are 48% below, highlighting upsell opportunities.

• Device Usage: Mobile accounts for 47.8% of active users, but desktop and smart TVs remain valuable segments.

• Churn: High churn rate is concentrated among monthly subscribers, requiring targeted retention strategies.

• Growth Trends: MRR and ARR fluctuations indicate inconsistent engagement, signaling the need for strategic campaigns.


**Recommendations for Improvement**

• Localize marketing campaigns in West, North, and East regions to maximize revenue opportunities.

• Strengthen Premium plans with loyalty perks like bonus months or exclusive content to reduce churn.

• Encourage Basic users to upgrade through targeted upsell campaigns and promotions.

• Enhance the mobile user experience to increase engagement, given its dominant usage share.

• Implement churn-reduction tactics such as win-back messages and automated email reminders for monthly plan users.

**Conclusion**

The NaijaStream project demonstrates the critical importance of leveraging data analytics in subscription-based businesses. 
By addressing churn, optimizing regional strategies, and enhancing user engagement across devices, NaijaStream can solidify its market position, 
boost profitability, and ensure sustainable growth in Nigeria’s dynamic digital media landscape.
